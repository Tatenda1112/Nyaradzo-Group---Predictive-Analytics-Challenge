# Nyaradzo-Group---Predictive-Analytics-Challenge
#In this project l collaborate with Macbeth Ndlovhu  
 The problem is to develop a predictive analytics model that accurately forecasts the utilization of consultants across all branches of an organization, taking into consideration seasonal patterns. The goal is to predict the future utilization of consultants, considering the number of files received at each branch and the time it takes for consultants to close files.
